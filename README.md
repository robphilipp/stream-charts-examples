# stream-charts-examples

Examples for [stream-charts](https://github.com/robphilipp/stream-charts).

There are currently two examples, one for each of the support chart types:
1. A neuron [raster chart](src/app/examples/StreamingRasterChart.tsx)
2. A time-series [scatter chart](src/app/examples/StreamingScatterChart.tsx)

## running examples

Install the dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

Run the development server, which should fire up a browser and load the example app.
```
$ npm start
```
