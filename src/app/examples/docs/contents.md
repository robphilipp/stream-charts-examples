### what do these pages cover?

Each of the tabs in the tabs presents an example of a particular chart type.

Currently, there are five chart types available, each presented as an example in one of the tabs.

1. **Scatter** – Used for plotting multiple time-series. The data are connected by a line and can have markers.
2. **Raster** – Used for plotting time-events (such as the firing of a neuron).
3. **Poincare** – Used when looking for auto-correlations in a time-series. Accepts a time-series as input and plots `d[i+n]` (y-axis) against `d[i]` (x-axis) where `n` is the lag. Provides the Tent map, Gaussian map, and the Logistic map as examples.
4. **Bar** – Used for plotting multiple time-series as bars that show the current value, min/max, and mean values.
5. **Outlier** – Used for displaying a single time-series that is annotated with model bounds.


The next pages describe:
1. the anatomy of the example charts,
2. common control bar functions,
3. control bar functions specific to each chart type and what the chart represents,
4. legends, 
5. tooltips, and
6. a description of each chart type.

[//]: # (The example charts in this application provide a set of controls that can be used to adjust the chart's behavior. These controls are placed above the chart. For example, in the scatter chart example there is a checkbox that enables the tooltip when the user mouses over a series. There is also a marker checkbox that displays markers for each data point. A dropdown enables the user to select the interpolation method used to draw the lines between data points. And a legend checkbox enables you to toggle the visibility of the legend. When the legend is visible, you're presented with a legend dropdown that allows you to select the placement of the legend.)
