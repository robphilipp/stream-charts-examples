 * element captures the pointer) rather than picking whichever entry happens to report the smallest
 * geometric distance across all entries.
 *
 * This distinction matters whenever two entries visually overlap: e.g. a bar-chart's value-line
 * segment is drawn on top of (and can extend slightly beyond) its min/max bar's rect. A rect is a
 * containment test -- any point inside it is unambiguously "hit," with no notion of "how close" --
 * so comparing it against a segment's proximity-based distance would let the rect win everywhere
 * the two overlap, even dead-center on the line, since 0 distance beats any nonzero one. Since
 * plots insert geometry in the same order they draw it, checking entries topmost-first resolves
 * this the way it looks on screen: whichever shape is drawn last (visually on top) claims the
 * pointer first, and only falls through to earlier (lower) entries where it doesn't match at all.
 *
 * Within a single entry (e.g. Scatter's many polyline segments, or Raster's many disjoint spikes)
