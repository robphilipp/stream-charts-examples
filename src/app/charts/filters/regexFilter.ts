 * render loop, not just one call. Delegates to the `safe-regex` package, which walks the regex's
 * actual parsed structure (via `regexp-tree`) rather than pattern-matching its source string, so
 * it catches more than a hand-rolled "look for nested quantifiers" check would.
 * @param pattern The regex (or its string source) to check
