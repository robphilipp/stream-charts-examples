 * ever *read* from it -- its `series`, and its `chartDataUpdatesObservable` notifications, which a plot subscribes

 * chart is unmounted (e.g. the user navigated to another page) without any subscription bound to
 * an unmounted plot instance being kept alive, adopted, or torn down later on.
 *
 * Unlike earlier designs, there is never more than one subscription to the generator, and it
 * exists only while the source is running.
